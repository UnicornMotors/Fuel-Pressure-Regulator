"The standard holley 12-803 is what I run, but with an external carter fuel pump which struggles to get past 8 psi. With a stock EFI in tank pump, I would think that any regulator designed for a carb would have issues. I ran into the same problem on my 88 dodge that I converted to carb from EFI, even with the same regulator I could not get pressures on either side of the regulator down low enough for the 1406 carb I was running. I swapped the in tank pump to a carb rated one and no more over pressure. I would definitly suggest just swapping the pump to a lower pressure carb unit and going with the 12-803 as opposed to that crazy expensive 12-879, probably cheaper that way too."

"I'm running a Holley Blue electric pump and have tried both of the Holley regulators posted. The return line was essential to keep the fuel pressure stable so the 12-803BP was used. In addition to that, what I had for a return line was too small as the 5/16ths OEM return line was long gone (this chassis was originally an EFI V6 ). I tried the 1/4" vapour line (charcoal canister to tank) however that was too small and fuel pressure would spike. I added a length of -6AN to work as the return and now I can keep the fuel pressure at a steady 5-6 PSI."

Don't work
I bought it hooked it all up to a electric fuel pump and it's says it's for 4 1/2 to 9 psi and it's preset at 6 but when I turn the key the pressure jumps up to 20 and then down to like 2 psi no matter where I set it at......
