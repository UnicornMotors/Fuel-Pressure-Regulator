# Review:
This one Failed for me and destroyed my Carburetor's accelerator pump Diaphragm! The ball may've gotten stuck? When I measured it was getting well over 25 Psi and maxing out my gauge, meaning it wasn't working At All! It's range is supposed to be 4-9 psi.

Either way, the construction & design is way too Cheap to be worth $65! It should cost about $12. It's a simple die cast case with a hemisphere attached to a plate, a diaphragm, a single spring, a pressure screw, super simple and cheap to manufacture! I could make something comparable from a hardware store for $20.
